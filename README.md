# AI-Projects
A collection of experiments, prototypes, and ideas where I explore the power (and quirks) of Large Language Models (LLMs). From resume analyzers to smarter search tools, this repo documents how I play with AI what works, what doesn’t, and how I think it could be better.
Expect:
- 💡 Creative use cases for LLMs
- 🛠️ Hands-on code and quick demos
- 📚 Lessons learned from building in public
- 🤖 Thoughts on improving model behavior and UX
Whether you're an AI enthusiast, builder, or just curious—dive in, fork it, and let’s push the boundaries of what LLMs can do.
